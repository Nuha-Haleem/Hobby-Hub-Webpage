# Hobby-Hub-Webpage
This project created for collage purpose (using language HTML, CSS, and, JS)
brief intro about webpage

HTML is used to create the main structure of the webpage. But the webpage is just like a structure. So 
to beautify this structure I use CSS. This makes the webpage attractive and beautiful. It gives a style to 
the webpage. VueJs is used to create feedback on food recipes. So people can insert their comments 
and support to the website through it. JavaScript is used to make the webpage interactive. It shows 
what the user is doing through the webpage.
